## Bias
Impact: Cosistently incorrect predictions, high bias results in underfit
Cause: Error from poor model assumptions

## Variance
Impact: Inconsistently predictions, high vairance results in overfit
Cause: Error from over complex models that are too sensitive to training data

## Noise
Impact: Noise sets lower bound in genelization error
(*Genelization error: error that a model makes on unseen data)
Cause: Irreducible error inherent to the problem. Eg. you cannot predict the outcome of a flip of a
fair coin any more than 50% of the time.
