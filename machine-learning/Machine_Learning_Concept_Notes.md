## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

### Definition
- **Supervised Learning**: Training data includes input **and labels**.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Training data includes only input **without labels**.

### Core Idea
Supervised = learning from examples with correct answers.  
Unsupervised = discovering patterns without knowing the answers.

### When It Applies
- Supervised → prediction tasks (classification, regression).
- Unsupervised → clustering, grouping, anomaly detection.

### Common Misunderstandings
- You **do not** need labels for test data in supervised learning — only train data requires labels.
- Unsupervised learning does not mean “no correctness,” it means “no labels.”

### How to Remember It
If you're teaching a student with an answer key → supervised.  
If you're giving them data and asking “what do you notice?” → unsupervised.

### Example
- Supervised: Predict if an email is spam (training data has spam/not spam labels).
- Unsupervised: Group customers by similarity with no predefined categories.
